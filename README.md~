# CompArch_HW1
Authors: Zhengqi Xi and Arnold Wey
A simple 2 bit intruction set with 3 instructions: JNP, HALT, and INC. Since this is our first time working with Verilog, the code is quite messy, and definietly can be done cleaner. Also, a C++ file included that takes an input file and compiles it to instructions (doThis.why) to be fed into the Verilog simulator.
Note: Anything with the format *_tb is a test file for the module.
